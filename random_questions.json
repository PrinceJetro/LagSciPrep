            "correct_option": "B",
            "explanation": "A molecule is defined as two or more atoms chemically bonded together. O₂ fits this definition. However, a compound specifically requires that the bonded atoms be from *different* elements. Since O₂ contains only oxygen atoms, it is a molecule but not a compound."

            "explanation": "The relationship is hierarchical. A compound is a subset of molecules. All compounds are molecules because they consist of two or more atoms chemically bonded. However, not all molecules are compounds, as some (like O₂, N₂) consist of atoms of the same element."

            "correct_option": "C",
            "explanation": "Iodine (I) is the element. I₂ is the molecular form in which two iodine atoms are chemically bonded together. Since it contains only one type of element, it is a molecule but does not meet the criteria to be called a compound."

            "explanation": "Both H₂O and CO are substances formed by the chemical combination of two different elements (H and O; C and O) in fixed proportions. This makes them chemical compounds. They are also molecules, but the most specific shared classification is 'compounds.'"

            "correct_option": "D",
            "explanation": "Ammonia (NH₃) consists of nitrogen and hydrogen atoms chemically bonded, making it a molecule. Because it contains atoms of different elements, it is also a compound. O₃ and N₂ are molecules of a single element, and Au is an elemental solid, not a molecular substance."

            "correct_option": "B",
            "explanation": "This statement is logically true. The category 'molecule' is broader. Some molecules (diatomics like O₂) are not compounds. However, any substance that qualifies as a compound (different elements bonded) inherently fits the definition of a molecule. Therefore, all compounds fall within the set of molecules."
