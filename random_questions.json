    "question": "Which of the following correctly explains why increasing temperature generally increases reaction rate?",
    "topic": "Past Questions CHM 101",
    "options": {
      "A": "It decreases the activation energy of the reaction",
      "B": "It increases the kinetic energy of molecules, increasing the frequency of effective collisions",
      "C": "It increases the concentration of products",
      "D": "It alters the stoichiometry of the reaction"
    },
    "correct_option": "B",
    "explanation": "Increasing temperature raises the kinetic energy of molecules. This leads to more frequent collisions and a higher proportion of collisions that have sufficient energy to overcome the activation energy barrier, thus increasing the reaction rate.",
    "hint": "Think about how temperature affects molecular motion and the energy of collisions."

    "question": "Which statement about catalysts is FALSE?",
    "topic": "Past Questions CHM 101",
    "options": {
      "A": "Catalysts lower the activation energy of a reaction",
      "B": "Catalysts do not alter the equilibrium position",
      "C": "Catalysts are consumed during the reaction",
      "D": "Catalysts increase the rate of both forward and reverse reactions"
    },
    "correct_option": "C",
    "explanation": "Catalysts provide an alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy. They are not consumed in the overall reaction and can be used repeatedly. They increase the rates of both the forward and reverse reactions, helping the system reach equilibrium faster without shifting the equilibrium position.",
    "hint": "Consider whether the catalyst is used up or if it remains unchanged at the end of the reaction."

    "question": "The rate law for a reaction is given by rate = k[A]^a * [B]. What is the order of the reaction?",
    "topic": "Past Questions CHM 101",
    "options": {
      "A": "First order",
      "B": "Third order",
      "C": "Second order",
      "D": "Zero order"
    },
    "correct_option": "B",
    "explanation": "The overall order of a reaction is the sum of the exponents in its rate law. Here, the exponent for [A] is 'a' and for [B] is 1. Although 'a' is not a number, the question implicitly uses 'a' as an exponent, but the provided rate law 'rate = k[A]^a * [B]' is likely a typo in the notes. Based on common question patterns, if 'a' is considered to be 2, then the sum of exponents (2 + 1) equals 3, making it third order.",
    "hint": "Add up all the exponents of the concentration terms in the rate law."

      "D": "Reach zero"
    },
    "correct_option": "C",
    "explanation": "At equilibrium, the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal, so the net change in the concentrations of reactants and products is zero. This means their concentrations become constant, though not necessarily equal to each other.",
    "hint": "Equilibrium is a state of balance where macroscopic properties do not change."

      "C": "Removing NH3",
      "D": "Adding a catalyst"
    },
    "correct_option": "B",
    "explanation": "Increasing the pressure favors the side with fewer moles of gas. The left side (N2 + 3H2) has 4 moles of gas, and the right side (2NH3) has 2 moles. Higher pressure will therefore shift the equilibrium to the right, producing more ammonia.",
    "hint": "Apply Le Chatelier's principle. Consider which side of the reaction has fewer gas molecules."

    },
    "correct_option": "B",
    "explanation": "According to Le Chatelier's principle, if a system at equilibrium is disturbed by increasing the concentration of a reactant, the equilibrium will shift to consume that reactant, favoring the forward reaction and thus shifting to the product side.",

    "correct_option": "C",
    "explanation": "Activation energy is the minimum amount of energy that colliding molecules must possess for a reaction to occur. It is the energy barrier that must be overcome for reactants to be converted into products.",

      "D": "Increases rate constant"
    },
    "correct_option": "C",
    "explanation": "For an exothermic reaction, heat is a product. Increasing temperature adds heat, which disturbs the equilibrium. According to Le Chatelier's principle, the system will shift to consume the added heat, favoring the endothermic (reverse) reaction, thus shifting the equilibrium toward reactants.",
    "hint": "Treat heat as a product in an exothermic reaction. Which way will the equilibrium shift if you add a product?"

      "C": "Rate = k[A]^2",
      "D": "Rate = k[A][B]^2"
    },
    "correct_option": "C",
    "explanation": "The overall order of a reaction is the sum of the exponents. For Rate = k[A]^2, the exponent is 2, making it second order. Rate = k[A][B] would also be second order (1+1), but that option is not listed. Option D is third order.",
    "hint": "A second-order reaction can have a rate proportional to the square of one reactant's concentration."

    },
    "correct_option": "C",
    "explanation": "The equilibrium constant, Kc, is the ratio of product concentrations to reactant concentrations at equilibrium. A large Kc (>>1) means that at equilibrium, the concentration of products is much greater than that of reactants, indicating the products are favored.",

      "B": "The equilibrium shifts to the left",
      "C": "The equilibrium shifts to the right",
      "D": "No change"
    },
    "correct_option": "B",

The enthalpy change (ΔH) for the phase change is not zero (it's the latent heat), but the statement as written is ambiguous. In the context of this question, none of the listed processes have ΔH=0. Phase changes have a specific ΔH, combustions, ionizations, and neutralizations all have non-zero enthalpy changes. This question likely has a trick. However, based on common misconceptions, at a phase change temperature, adding heat changes the phase, not the temperature, so ΔT=0, but ΔH is not zero. The question asks for ΔH=0, which is not true for any of these. This is a poorly constructed question from the notes. The provided notes do not contain a correct answer for this. The safest answer based on common knowledge is none, but since one must be chosen, it's likely a trick question.
